# shopifychallenge
An Image Repository

This is the solution to a shopify challenge for their Data Engineering internship role

To check the functionality of the web app, you will make use of your linux terminal #windows or mac too works
**Step 1: git clone this repository to your local computer**
```
git clone https://github.com/husseinalamutu/shopifychallenge.git
```
Make sure to create a virtual environment on your local computer befor proceeding, you would also need to download djngo and python, if they don't exist on your system.

**Step 2:run a local server**
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
*Note: This should be done from the root directory that contains the manage.py package*
A local server would now be running on port 8000, click on the link shown in your terminal using shift and left mouse click or better still open your browser and put in the link manually **localhost:8000**

Now the site would be live

### Actions that can be peformed ###

The base url redirects to a login page, you can use this 
```
username: alamz
password: SHOPIFYchallenge
```

or this
```
username: shopify
password: SHOPIFYchallenge02
```
You can interact with the front end of the website, add photos, update or delete products(this works with permissions for the user that uploaded the products initially).

Also, you can access the backend of the sitw using 
```
localhost:8000/admin
```
Use the *alamz* username and it's password to login

Meanwhile, this app was built in a day, just got to hear of the internship and my passion for software and amzing tech products like shopify kicked me into gear. Hopefully I would be selected.

***Thanks Y'all, Take care.***
